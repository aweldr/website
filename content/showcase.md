# My Work

Here's some of the Data Analysis I've done in R. I don't use R as much as I used to but I still
love doing simply data exploration/graphing in it.

A lot of my public work had to be taken down due to my current job as it dealt with hockey analytics
with a NHL focus. I'm starting to branch out into other things such as NBA analysis and fintech in
the public spheres these days.
