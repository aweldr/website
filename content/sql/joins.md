Ok now that you have the database up and can now do some basic queries
from the [last tutorial](({{< ref "/sql/sqlbasics" >}}) you are probably
wondering how do you actually tell which players are achieveing which
stats. In the few tables we looked at there are no actual player names, only
what's called `playerid` which looks like a weird combination of a name
and a number. Some aren't even full names either way it doesn't really
tell you who is doing what in the database.
