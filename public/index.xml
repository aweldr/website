      <description>My Work Rpubs Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the Data Analysis I&amp;rsquo;ve done in R. I don&amp;rsquo;t use R as much as I used to but I still love doing simply data exploration/graphing in it.
Github A lot of my public work had to be taken down due to my current job as it dealt with hockey analytics with a NHL focus. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to branch out into other things such as NBA analysis and fintech in the public spheres these days.</description>

      <description>The Rebuild Has Begun Due to a lot (well a few) people asking me about my tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bring them back. And It gives me a chance to revamp the old website with a little slicker format. So stay tuned as I slowly work to get things back in the shape they were before. As always you can address any concerns, questions, or requests to barloweanalytics@gmail.com.</description>
