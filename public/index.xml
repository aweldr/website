      <description>by Matthew Barlowe &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; is a very common first program for just about any programming langauge. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some history behind it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered to look it up. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just a simple program of very limited lines that prints out the phrase &amp;ldquo;Hello World.&amp;rdquo; The purpose of this tutorial is to get you setup to write that first program.
Getting Started The first thing to do is open your favorite text editor.</description>

      <description>by Matthew Barlowe Ok so if you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Homebrew Tutorial you are ready to actually start using it to start programming in python. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read that tutorial and you want to follow this one I sugestt going back and reading that one first. First though we need to get your system properly setup to run python safely and avoid problems in the future. The first step to doing that is to install Apple&amp;rsquo;s Xcode utilities, specifically GCC.</description>

      <description>by Matthew Barlowe Homebrew is a very usefual package manager that can be installed on the macOS system. It&amp;rsquo;s what I use to manage by Python installations along with my SQL database as well. It has a nice, easy to learn, syntax and is simple to install from the terminal on an Apple computer. What is a package manager you ask? Well join me in the next section and we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the details behind it.</description>

      <description>by Matthew Barlowe So if you&amp;rsquo;ve started out doing a little coding either for fun or like me to try and do data analysis of the NHL, then you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard people talk a lot about Git and Github. And if you were like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve even tried to learn it, or use it, but just got so frustrated you gave up and figured it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the time.</description>

      <description>Rpubs Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the Data Analysis I&amp;rsquo;ve done in R. I don&amp;rsquo;t use R as much as I used to but I still love doing simple data exploration/graphing in it.
Github A lot of my public work had to be taken down due as it dealt with NHL analytics. I&amp;rsquo;ve branched out into other things such as NBA analysis and fintech in the public sphere these days.
LinkedIn Standard LinkedIn stuff including some of the presentations I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past on hockey analytics</description>

      <description>The Rebuild Has Begun Due to a lot (well a few) people asking me about my tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bring them back. And It gives me a chance to revamp the old website with a little slicker format. So stay tuned as I slowly work to get things back in the shape they were before. As always you can address any concerns, questions, or requests to barloweanalytics@gmail.com.</description>
