      <description>The Rebuild Has Begun Due to a lot (well a few) people asking me about my tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bring them back. And It gives me a chance to revamp the old website with a little slicker format. So stay tuned as I slowly work to get things back in the shape they were before. As always you can address any concerns, questions, or requests to barloweanalytics@gmail.com.</description>
